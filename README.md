# Elec_net
A online election system

Each user had to register once before the “Election day”. Each user was given a unique password (Private key) while registering. The password details and a confirmation link was sent by mail to the user. User can log in and has to wait for voting until the Election Day. On the day of the election, voting module would be enabled and user can vote. At the end of the day, all votes would be calculated and the winner of the elections would be declared the next day.
The website was hosted locally using a wamp server. Php MySql was used for the database connectivity.

A user could change his vote as the first time he may have been forced to vote. This additional feature  received a lot of praise at the same time was criticized as it wasn’t a biased option.

Technologies used:
HTML,CSS,JS, PHP, Sendmail, MySql, Wamp

	
Future implementations:
•	Collaborate with the government for using the Aadhaar Card database for validating users authenticity during the registrations.
•	It has also been suggested that the campaigning dates can also be displayed on the site.
